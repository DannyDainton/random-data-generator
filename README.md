## random-data-generator

This is a very basic app to create random test data using the Casual.js module.

#### Install dependencies
From a command window type the following:

`npm install`

#### Getting the random data
From a command window type the following:

`node data.js` 

This will console log the random data specified in the file.

`node user.js` 

This will console log the user data that includes a First Name, Last Name and a Password.

`node cardDetails.js` 

This will create a JSON file with random payment card details that can be used within the Bug Magnet Chrome Extension.
